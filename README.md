# Ansible Role: ansible-role-cnos-telemetry - Configuring Telemetry report on Lenovo CNOS device
This role configures telemetry reports on the Lenovo CNOS devices.
The results of the operation can be viewed in *results* directory.

## Requirements

* Ansible 2.4 installed.  [Ansible Installation Instructions](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/intro_installation.html)
* Lenovo CNOS network device version 10.5 or later
* Restapi Feature enabled on switch
* an SSH connection to the Lenovo switch (SSH must be enabled on the network device)

## Role Variables
---
<add role variables information below>

Available variables are listed below, along with description.

The following are mandatory inventory variables:

Variable | Description
--- | ---
`username` | Specifies the username used to log into the switch
`password` | Specifies the password used to log into the switch
`hostname` | Searches the hosts file at */etc/ansible/hosts* and identifies the IP address of the switch on which the role is going to be applied
`deviceType` | Specifies the type of device from where the configuration will be backed up (**g8272_cnos** - G8272, **g8296_cnos** - G8296)

The values of the variables used need to be modified to fit the specific scenario in which you are deploying the solution. To change the values of the variables, you need to visits the *vars* directory of each role and edit the *main.yml* file located there. The values stored in this file will be used by Ansible when the template is executed.

The syntax of *main.yml* file for variables is the following:

```
<template variable>:<value>
```

You will need to replace the `<value>` field with the value that suits your topology. The `<template variable>` fields are taken from the template and it is recommended that you leave them unchanged.

## Dependencies
---
<add dependencies information below>

- username.iptables - Configures the firewall and blocks all ports except those needed for http(port=8090) or https(port=443) server and ssh server.
- /etc/ansible/hosts - You must edit the */etc/ansible/hosts* file with the device information of the switches.

Ansible keeps track of all network elements that it manages through a hosts file. Before the execution of a playbook, the hosts file must be set up.

Open the */etc/ansible/hosts* file with root privileges. Most of the file is commented out by using **#**. You can also comment out the entries you will be adding by using **#**. You need to copy the content of the hosts file for the role into the */etc/ansible/hosts* file.
  
```
[cnos_restapi_sample]
10.241.107.39   username=<username> password=<password> deviceType=g8272_cnos
10.241.107.40   username=<username> password=<password> deviceType=g8272_cnos
```
  
**Note:** You need to change the IP addresses to fit your specific topology. You also need to change the `<username>` and `<password>` to the appropriate values used to log into the specific Lenovo network devices.


## Example Playbook
---
<add playbook samples below>

To execute an Ansible playbook, use the following command:

```
ansible-playbook cnos_telemetry_sample.yml -vvv
```

`-vvv` is an optional verbos command that helps identify what is happening during playbook execution. The playbook for each role is located in the main directory of the solution.

```
- name: Module to configure telemetry reports
   hosts: cnos_telemetry_sample
   gather_facts: no
   connection: local
   roles:
    - cnos_telemetry_sample
```
         
### Module and Role Deployment
 Download the zip or tar.gz file containing and unzip into local directory. 
 The module, cnos_template.py has to be accessed from ansible github while cnos_restapi.py is provided in the library folder.
